      "detail": "The Monstera deliciosa is a relatively low-maintenance houseplant that thrives with consistent, attentive care. It flourishes in a spot with bright, indirect light, which is crucial for the development of its signature split leaves. Water your Monstera thoroughly when the top two inches of soil feel dry to the touch, and be careful to avoid overwatering, as it can quickly lead to root rot. A well-draining soil mix that mimics its natural, chunky environment is ideal, and it will appreciate higher humidity levels, which you can provide by misting or using a humidifier. During the growing season, a regular feeding schedule with a balanced liquid fertilizer will support its vigorous growth. Pruning is beneficial to manage its size and encourage bushier growth; simply cut just below a node. Propagation is straightforward through stem cuttings, which can be rooted in water or soil. Keep an eye out for common issues such as yellowing leaves from overwatering or brown edges due to low humidity, and adjust care accordingly to keep your Monstera thriving.",

"tips": ["Wipe leaves with a damp cloth to keep them glossy.", "Rotate pot occasionally for even growth."],

"detail": "Ficus elastica is a low-maintenance houseplant that thrives indoors in bright, indirect light but can also tolerate lower light conditions. It requires minimal pruning and is relatively pest-resistant. Its large, glossy leaves make it a striking decorative plant, and with proper care, it can live for many years.",

"watering": {
"description": "Prefers infrequent but deep watering.",
"tips": ["Allow the top 2 inches of soil to dry before watering again.", "Reduce watering in winter when growth slows."],
"issues": ["Overwatering can cause root rot."],
"detail": "Ficus elastica thrives on a careful balance of moisture. The soil should be allowed to partially dry out between watering sessions to avoid soggy conditions that can damage roots. During the active growing season (spring and summer), more frequent watering may be necessary, while in winter, watering should be reduced.",
"frequency": "Every 1â€“2 weeks during growing season; every 2â€“3 weeks in winter.",

},
"light": {
"description": "Prefers bright, indirect light but tolerates moderate light.",
"idealHours": "6â€“8 hours of indirect light daily.",
"detail": "Ficus elastica grows best in bright, indirect sunlight, which enhances the deep green and sometimes variegated foliage. While it can adapt to lower light conditions, growth may slow, and leaves may lose vibrancy. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so filtered light is ideal.",
"howToImages": ["images/ficus-elastica/light1.jpg", "images/ficus-elastica/light2.jpg"],
"tips": ["Avoid harsh afternoon sun to prevent leaf burn.", "Rotate plant to encourage even growth."]
},
"medium": {
"description": "Prefers well-draining, fertile potting soil.",
"detail": "Ficus elastica thrives in a soil mix that balances moisture retention with good aeration. A peat-based potting mix combined with perlite or coarse sand ensures adequate drainage while keeping roots healthy. Heavy soils that retain too much water should be avoided.",
"howToImages": ["images/ficus-elastica/medium1.jpg", "images/ficus-elastica/medium2.jpg"],
"tips": ["Use a well-draining indoor potting mix.", "Repot every 2â€“3 years to refresh soil and promote growth."]
},
"propagation": {
"description": "Propagated through stem cuttings or air layering.",
"detail": "The most common method of propagating Ficus elastica is by taking stem cuttings with a few leaves and rooting them in water or soil. Air layering is another effective method, where a stem section is encouraged to root while still attached to the plant before being cut and replanted.",
"tips": ["Use rooting hormone to increase success rates.", "Propagate in spring or early summer for best results."],

"toxicity": {
"description": "Ficus elastica is toxic to humans and pets if ingested, causing mouth and stomach irritation. Its milky sap may also cause skin irritation."
