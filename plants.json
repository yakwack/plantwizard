It flourishes in a spot with bright, indirect light, which is crucial for the development of its signature split leaves. Water your Monstera thoroughly when the top two inches of soil feel dry to the touch, and be careful to avoid overwatering, as it can quickly lead to root rot. A well-draining soil mix that mimics its natural, chunky environment is ideal, and it will appreciate higher humidity levels, which you can provide by misting or using a humidifier. During the growing season, a regular feeding schedule with a balanced liquid fertilizer will support its vigorous growth. Pruning is beneficial to manage its size and encourage bushier growth; simply cut just below a node. Propagation is straightforward through stem cuttings, which can be rooted in water or soil. Keep an eye out for common issues such as yellowing leaves from overwatering or brown edges due to low humidity, and adjust care accordingly to keep your Monstera thriving.",
