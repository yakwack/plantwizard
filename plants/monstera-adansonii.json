  "scientificName": "Monstera adansonii",
  "etymology": "The name 'Monstera' is Latin for 'monstrous,' referring to its large size and unusual appearance. 'Adansonii' is named after the French botanist Michel Adanson.",
  "history": "A native of Central and South American rainforests, the Monstera adansonii is a vining plant known for its distinct, prominent holes (fenestrations) that appear on its leaves from a young age. It is a smaller relative of the more famous Monstera deliciosa and has recently become a very popular houseplant due to its unique appearance and easy care.",

    "description": "A fast-growing vining plant that requires bright, indirect light and a humid environment.",
    "tips": [
      "Provide a moss pole or trellis for it to climb, which will result in larger leaves.",
      "Ensure high humidity, especially if you live in a dry climate."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "<strong>Brown, crispy tips:</strong> A sign of low humidity or underwatering. Mist the plant and increase humidity.",
      "<strong>Yellowing leaves:</strong> Usually from overwatering. Let the soil dry out more between waterings.",
      "<strong>Lack of holes or new growth:</strong> Indicates insufficient light or lack of a climbing surface."
    ],
    "detail": "Monstera adansonii is a beautiful vining plant known for its unique 'holey' leaves. It is a faster grower than its larger cousin, Monstera deliciosa, and will thrive in a warm, humid environment with plenty of bright, indirect light. A chunky, well-draining soil mix is essential to prevent root rot. You can let the vines trail from a hanging basket, or for a more impressive plant with larger leaves, provide a moss pole or trellis for it to climb. It's a great choice for adding a touch of the jungle to your home.",

    ],
    "issues": [
      "Overwatering is the leading cause of death. Leaves will turn yellow and the plant will eventually die from root rot."
    ],
    "detail": "Water your Monstera adansonii when the top inch or two of soil has dried out. It's important to let the soil dry out a bit between waterings to prevent root rot. In the summer, you may need to water more frequently, while in the winter months, you can cut back. The plant will show signs of thirst by having slightly drooping leaves, and it will quickly perk up after a good watering.",
    "frequency": "Every 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 weeks, depending on humidity and light",

    "description": "Prefers bright, indirect light.",
    "idealHours": "6-8 hours",
    "detail": "Monstera adansonii thrives in bright, indirect light. Placing it near a window that gets filtered light is a perfect location. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can burn the delicate leaves. In too little light, the plant's growth will slow, and its leaves will not develop their signature holes and may be smaller than normal.",

    "description": "A chunky, airy, and well-draining soil mix.",
    "detail": "A well-draining, airy soil mix is essential for a Monstera adansonii. A mix of potting soil, perlite, and a coarse material like orchid bark or coco coir will work best. This mimics its natural environment and helps prevent the roots from becoming waterlogged. Ensure your pot has good drainage holes.",

    "description": "Easily propagated from stem cuttings in water or soil.",
    "detail": "Propagation of Monstera adansonii is very easy. Simply take a stem cutting that has at least one node and a leaf attached. You can place the cutting in a glass of water, and it will quickly develop roots. Once the roots are a few inches long, you can plant it in soil. Alternatively, you can plant the cutting directly in a pot with moist soil and keep it in a humid, warm spot until it takes root.",
    "tips": [
      "Ensure your cutting has at least one node.",
      "A propagation box or bag can help maintain humidity for faster rooting."
