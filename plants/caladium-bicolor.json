  "scientificName": "Caladium bicolor",
  "etymology": "The genus name 'Caladium' comes from the Latinized form of the Malay word 'keladi,' meaning 'plant with edible roots.' The species name 'bicolor' refers to the striking two-toned patterns found in the foliage.",
  "history": "Caladium bicolor is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and has been cultivated for centuries for its vibrant ornamental foliage. It became widely popular in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries as part of the Victorian fascination with exotic tropical plants.",

    "description": "Caladium bicolor requires warm, humid conditions and indirect light for optimal growth.",
    "tips": [
      "Provide consistent humidity for best foliage.",
      "Remove faded leaves to encourage new growth."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "<strong>Leaf scorch:</strong> caused by direct sunlight, move plant to shaded area.",
      "<strong>Yellowing leaves:</strong> caused by overwatering, reduce watering frequency."
    ],
    "detail": "Caladium bicolor thrives in tropical conditions with warm temperatures and high humidity. It is best suited for shaded areas, making it an excellent choice for indoor or outdoor decorative planting in filtered light. Regular care includes monitoring watering, keeping the soil moist but not soggy, and providing warmth during its growing season.",

    "issues": [
      "Overwatering can cause root rot."
    ],
    "detail": "Caladium bicolor requires regular watering during its active growing season, ensuring the soil remains evenly moist. However, during dormancy in the cooler months, watering should be significantly reduced as the plant conserves energy in its tubers. Good drainage is essential to prevent rot.",
    "frequency": "Every 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 days during growing season, less during dormancy.",
