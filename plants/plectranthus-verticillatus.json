    "detail": "Plectranthus verticillatus is a beautiful and incredibly forgiving plant that is perfect for beginners. It has a charming vining habit and coin-shaped leaves that will trail gracefully from a hanging basket or shelf. It thrives in bright, indirect light and likes its soil to be kept slightly moist. It's a fast grower, and you can easily prune it back to maintain its shape and fullness. Its resilience to a variety of conditions makes it a fantastic addition to almost any home.",

    "detail": "Plectranthus verticillatus prefers to be kept evenly moist but can tolerate a bit of drying out. Water it when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. It is crucial to avoid overwatering, as this can cause root rot. If the leaves start to yellow and the stems feel mushy, you are overwatering. Ensure your pot has drainage holes to allow excess water to escape.",

You can also plant the cutting directly in moist soil and keep it in a warm, bright location.",
