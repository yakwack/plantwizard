  "etymology": "The genus name 'Aloe' is derived from the Arabic word 'alloeh,' meaning 'shining bitter substance,' referring to the bitter sap found in the leaves. 'Vera' is Latin for 'true,' suggesting it's the most authentic aloe.",
  "history": "Native to the Arabian Peninsula, Aloe vera has been used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes for thousands of years by civilizations including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Its gel is famous for soothing skin ailments, and its resilient nature has made it a popular houseplant worldwide.",

    "description": "A popular, low-maintenance succulent known for its medicinal properties and hardiness.",

      "Keep away from cold drafts and frost, as it is a tropical plant.",

    "issues": [
      "<strong>Mushy, brown leaves:</strong> A classic sign of overwatering. Let the soil dry out completely between waterings.",
      "<strong>Drooping leaves:</strong> Can be caused by underwatering or lack of light. Check soil moisture and light levels.",
      "<strong>Shriveled leaves:</strong> The plant is severely thirsty. Give it a thorough soak.",
      "<strong>Pale or thin leaves:</strong> Indicates a lack of light. Move the plant to a brighter location."
    ],
    "detail": "Aloe vera is a versatile succulent that is incredibly easy to care for. It thrives in bright, indirect light and tolerates some direct sun, but too much can scorch its leaves. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it very drought-tolerant and forgiving of neglect. The key to its care is proper watering: only water when the soil has completely dried out. It is a slow grower but will eventually produce 'pups,' which can be separated to create new plants.",

    "issues": [
      "Overwatering is the number one threat and will cause the roots to rot and the leaves to turn brown and mushy."
    ],
    "detail": "Aloe vera is very sensitive to overwatering. The soil should be allowed to dry out completely between waterings. The plant will tell you it's thirsty by its leaves becoming slightly shriveled and thin. Water thoroughly but infrequently, and always ensure your pot has good drainage to prevent root rot. During the winter, the plant's growth slows down, and you should reduce watering significantly.",
    "frequency": "Every 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 weeks, depending on light and temperature",

  "light": {
    "description": "Prefers bright, indirect light.",
    "idealHours": "6-8 hours",
    "detail": "Aloe vera thrives in bright, indirect light. An east- or west-facing window is an ideal spot. It can tolerate some direct morning sun, but avoid harsh afternoon sun, which can burn its leaves and cause them to turn reddish-brown. If the leaves look thin and pale, it's a sign the plant needs more light.",

    "description": "A well-draining, gritty soil mix for succulents.",
    "detail": "The most important thing for an Aloe vera is drainage. Use a pre-mixed succulent or cactus soil. A standard potting mix will retain too much moisture and can lead to root rot. You can also create your own mix with potting soil, coarse sand, and perlite to ensure the soil is airy and drains quickly.",

  "propagation": {
    "description": "Easily propagated from 'pups' or offsets that grow from the main plant.",
    "detail": "The easiest way to propagate Aloe vera is by removing the 'pups' or offsets that grow from the base of the mother plant. When the pup is a few inches tall and has its own root system, you can gently separate it from the main plant with a clean knife. Let the cut end of the pup dry and callus over for a day before planting it in a pot with well-draining soil. The new plant will quickly establish itself and begin to grow.",
    "tips": [
      "Wait for the pup to be a few inches tall before separating it.",
      "Allow the cut end to heal before planting."
