  "scientificName": "Monstera deliciosa",
  "etymology": "From Latin 'monstrum' (monster) referring to its unusually perforated leaves, and 'deliciosa' meaning delicious, describing its edible fruit.",
  "history": "Native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, Monstera deliciosa has been cultivated as a houseplant worldwide since the 19th century due to its striking foliage and ease of care.",

    "detail": "The Monstera deliciosa is a relatively low-maintenance houseplant that thrives with consistent, attentive care. It flourishes in a spot with bright, indirect light, which is crucial for the development of its signature split leaves. Water your Monstera thoroughly when the top two inches of soil feel dry to the touch, and be careful to avoid overwatering, as it can quickly lead to root rot. A well-draining soil mix that mimics its natural, chunky environment is ideal, and it will appreciate higher humidity levels, which you can provide by misting or using a humidifier. During the growing season, a regular feeding schedule with a balanced liquid fertilizer will support its vigorous growth. Pruning is beneficial to manage its size and encourage bushier growth; simply cut just below a node. Propagation is straightforward through stem cuttings, which can be rooted in water or soil. Keep an eye out for common issues such as yellowing leaves from overwatering or brown edges due to low humidity, and adjust care accordingly to keep your Monstera thriving.",

    "detail": "Water your Monstera deliciosa thoroughly when the top two inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Use room temperature water and ensure that the pot has adequate drainage holes to prevent water from sitting at the bottom, which can lead to root rot. During the growing season (spring and summer), you may need to water more frequently, while in the dormant season (fall and winter), reduce watering frequency. Always check the soil moisture before watering to avoid overwatering.",

    "description": "Cut a stem just below a node and root in water or soil.",
    "detail": "Propagation of Monstera deliciosa is typically done through stem cuttings. Select a healthy stem with at least one node and make a clean cut just below the node. You can root the cutting in water or directly in soil. If rooting in water, change the water every few days to keep it fresh. Once roots develop, usually within a few weeks, you can transplant the cutting into a pot with well-draining soil. Keep the new plant in a warm, humid environment with indirect light to encourage growth.",
